# ras-pie-final
Final Project For IOT Andrew/Jack
## pip install playsound@git+https://github.com/taconi/playsound
We are going to be making a program where you have to input a password, and if you get it wrong a bobble head will shake its head no and speakers or the buzzer will play an incorrect sound. If you get the password correct, the bobblehead will shake its head correct and play a correct sound.  We will connect to GUIZero and have buttons in the GUI to type the password in.
